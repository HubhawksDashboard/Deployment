Consider what is the most intriguing element of your story to have a catchy hook. If your book is fiction, think about what makes your plot unique. If the work is non-fiction, think about the distinct angle that you have chosen on the subject about which you are writing.s.

        Every great book has a conflict at its core. If your protagonist's life is constantly smooth, readers will grow impatient quickly. They want to read more because they want to see how the conflict unfolds. The idea is to make it challenging for potential readers to put the book down once they've read the blurb. You can tease your readers with the meaty details in your blurb, but avoid giving away too much. It might just kill the curiosity to explore more.

        A good blurb helps readers get a sense of the protagonist who will drive the action in the story. Since readers will be spending several hundred pages with them, it is important to give them assurance that they will love reading about their life. Rather than outlining their biography, give interesting details about their personality, which might pique readers' interest.
